# Cache-Memory-Management-using-Splay-Trees
This project implements a cache management system using Splay Trees. It allows efficient retrieval, insertion, and eviction of key-value pairs based on the least recently used (LRU) policy.
Features
Cache with a fixed capacity
Efficient retrieval of values based on keys
Insertion of new key-value pairs
Eviction of the least recently used entry when the cache is full
Implementation is provided for both single threaded as well as multithreaded environment
